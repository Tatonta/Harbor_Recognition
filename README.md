# Ship Recognition for Harbor safety
CNN and GAN processing on VAIS and SC5 datasets

Our team did transfer learning on the VAIS and SC5 datasets in order to recognize ships entering Genova's
harbor for safety reasons. Since the datasets wasn't very extensive, we used a GAN to generate more ships
images and add them to the original dataset. We tested differents Deep Neural Networks (GoogleNet,
Resnet17, Resnet152 and Alexnet) and assessed their performances through confusion matrices.
